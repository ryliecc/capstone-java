## Project Overview

The "Budget App" consists of a Java backend and a Vite React frontend with TypeScript. It leverages Docker for containerization, GitHub Actions for continuous integration, and Render for deployment. This ReadMe provides an overview of the project and its setup.

## Project Setup and Deployment

I've followed a structured approach to set up and deploy the "Budget App." Here are the key steps that have been completed:

1. **GitHub Repository Setup:**
    - A GitHub repository named "capstone-java" has been created to host the project.
    - The repository is initialized with a `.gitignore` file suitable for Java, Maven, and React/Vite with TypeScript.

2. **Backend Setup:**
    - A Maven project for the backend using Java has been created.

3. **Frontend Setup:**
    - A Vite React project with TypeScript for the frontend has been set up.

4. **Docker Image Creation:**
    - A Docker image for the full-stack application has been created using a Dockerfile.

5. **Docker Image Push to Docker Hub:**
    - Docker Hub credentials have been configured for the project.

6. **Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions:**
    - GitHub Actions have been set up for automated testing and deployment.
    - CI workflows build and test the full-stack application on every code push, including linting, unit tests, and integration tests.

7. **SonarCloud Integration:**
    - SonarCloud integration to perform code analysis and quality checks is in progress.

8. **Deployment with Render:**
    - A Render account has been set up and configured for deploying the full-stack application.
    - The deployment process is automated and triggered upon successful CI/CD pipeline completion.

9. **Documentation:**
    - Documentation regarding the setup and deployment process is being maintained.
